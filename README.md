# Old Phone Simulator

A simple web-based simulation of an old-style mobile phone keypad with T9 text input. 

## Features

- T9-style text input using number buttons (2-9).
- Cycle through letters by pressing the same key repeatedly.
- Remove last character (Remove button).
- Clear all input (Clear All button).
- Simple retro phone UI with clickable keypad buttons.

*This UI aims to give users the feeling of sending text messages the way it was done before smartphones existed.*
